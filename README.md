# DDPM for Quantitative MRI Parameter Estimation

This repository contains code for training and inference of **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)** applied to quantitative MRI (qMRI), focusing on Proton Density (PD) and T1 parameter mapping.

The implementation is based on **MONAIâ€™s diffusion model framework** and adapts the workflow for inverse problems in MRI.
